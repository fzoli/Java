A NetBeans Java Enterprise Application project using GlassFish webserver.

In this project you can see 4 NetBeansProject:
-ejb: contains an EJB that uses Entity classes with EclipseLink (JPA 2.1)
-war: the web application project uses the EJB and JSF with PrimeFaces library
-client: one-line client application
-lib: library project for client project

In this example I wrote a NodeModel for PrimeFaces' DefaultTreeNode.
If the model is cached, it loads data from the database when a Node is expanded
and clears invisible nodes when a node is collapsed.
If the model is not cached, the whole tree will be loaded from the database and the JSF page won't use AJAX.

In the war project I wrote an MBean that expands and collapses the non cached tree
and sends notificaion if a node of the cached tree is changed by the user.
You can test this bean if you connect to the application server with JConsole
or other JMX-client and find jmxtest.PrimeTree.

The EJB project contains a Web Service which WSDL URL is for example:
http://localhost:8080/TestWebService/Nodes?wsdl
