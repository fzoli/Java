A NetBeans Java Enterprise Application project using GlassFish webserver.

In this project you can see 4 NetBeansProject:
-ejb: contains an EJB that uses Entity classes with EclipseLink (JPA 2.1)
-war: the web application project uses the EJB and JSF with PrimeFaces library
-client: one-line client application
-lib: library project for client project

In this example I wrote a NodeModel for PrimeFaces' DefaultTreeNode.
If the model is cached, it loads data from the database when a Node is expanded
and clears invisible nodes when a node is collapsed.
If the model is not cached, the whole tree will be loaded from the database and the JSF page won't use AJAX.
